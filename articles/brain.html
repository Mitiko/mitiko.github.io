    <header><h1>Brain</h1></header>
    <p>
        There're plenty of reasons to write a blog post about the brain - to better understand our thoughts, to inspire
        better AI architectures, to expand the field of psychology, and just out of pure curiosity.
        My intentions for this piece of writing is probably inspired by all but I'm mostly interested
        in extracting the core principles of the workings of the human brain and applying them to artificial systems.
        For that, we'd need to consider the differences between human and machine:
    </p>
    <ul aria-label="Areas of interest">
        <li>Processing (power and speed)</li>
        <li>Memory (size and speed)</li>
        <li>Sensors (resolution)</li>
    </ul>
    <ul aria-label="Advantages of computers">
        <li>Faster processing</li>
        <li>Better at (extremely) specific tasks - playing chess, forecasting weather, etc.</li>
        <li>Better memory (exabytes of disk space and terabytes of random access memory)</li>
        <li>Superior sensors (on-par or better than human senses, and improving)</li>
    </ul>
    <ul aria-label="Advantages of human brains">
        <li>Evolutionary approved design</li>
        <li>More powerful in broader tasks - decision maing, content creation, problem solving, etc.</li>
        <li>Adaptive reward function</li>
    </ul>

        I'd be lying if I said this is my brain theory, for it can barely be called a theory.
        I prefer you look at it as a proposition for a model of the brain, explored in the context of psychology and AI.<br><br>

        I'll be talking about the (functionally) different "parts" of the brain but be not mistaken, evolution is not so caring
        as to organize brain cells in tidy groups for us to understand them better. Brain connections are chaotically formed and
        every statement about the brain can only be generally true with small ranges of

        There're 3 main types of <em>logical reasoning:</em>

            <b><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning" target="_blank">&lt;wiki&gt;</a></span> Deductive reasoning: </b>
            combining multiple premises to reach a logical conclusion<br>
            &#8594;Given all swans are mortal and your pet is a swan, then your pet is mortal.<br>
            Deductive reasoning goes top-down, restricting

        <li>
            <b>Inductive reasoning: </b>
            using a sample of posteriors to validate (with a factor of uncertainty) the posteriors of the similiar priors.
            If all swans seen are white, then all swans must be white. (Not exactly, because there're black swans)
