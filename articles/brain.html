    <header><h1>Brain</h1></header>
    <section>
    <p>
        There're plenty of reasons to write a blog post about the brain - to better understand our thoughts, to inspire
        better AI architectures, to expand the field of psychology, and just out of pure curiosity.
        My intentions for this piece of writing is probably inspired by all but I'm mostly interested
        in extracting the core principles of the workings of the human brain and applying them to artificial systems.
        For that, we'd need to consider the differences between human and machine:
    </p>
    <ul aria-label="Areas of interest">
        <li>Processing (power and speed)</li>
        <li>Memory (size and speed)</li>
        <li>Sensors (resolution)</li>
    </ul>
    <ul aria-label="Advantages of computers">
        <li>Faster processing</li>
        <li>Better at (extremely) specific tasks - playing chess, forecasting weather, etc.</li>
        <li>Better memory (exabytes of disk space and terabytes of random access memory)</li>
        <li>Superior sensors (on-par or better than human senses, and improving)</li>
    </ul>
    <ul aria-label="Advantages of human brains">
        <li>Evolutionary approved design</li>
        <li>More powerful in broader tasks - decision maing, content creation, problem solving, etc.</li>
        <li>Adaptive reward function</li>
        <li>Constantly active (how does sleep play a role?)</li>
        <li>Attached to a physical body; better motor functions</li>
        <li>Needs less data to make meaningful decisions (2-3 examples are enough, compared to thousands needed for current NN)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Machines have far surpassed us in any individual task but can't beat us to generality yet. In fact, this is a race with evolution!
        Evolution, the natural force of creation, has perfected the human being (and it's brain) but it could only do that in the span of
        millions of years. It is entropy-based, progress is achieved by mutations once a generation and is extremely slow and volatile.<br>
        The existence of lasers and microscopes is proof that we can beat evolution with premeditated optimizations. It is up to us to
        build a superior system, an AI, it is our turn to play god. We need to know what is essential to the daily brain functions,
        to learning, to problem solving, to creativity, in order to build the analogues in silicone.

    <h2>Preface</h2>
    <p>
        I'd be lying if I said this is my brain theory, for it can barely be called a theory.
        I prefer you look at it as a proposition for a model of the brain, explored in the context of psychology and AI.
        I am open to criticism and contributions.<br><br>

        I'll be talking about the (functionally) different "parts" of the brain but be not mistaken, evolution is not so caring
        as to organize brain cells in distinct tidy groups. [Brain] connections are chaotically formed and
        any statement about the brain can at best be <i>generally</i> true.<br><br>

        Don't get tangled in the ontologies of things, instead try to take a more
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formalism_(philosophy_of_mathematics)" target="_blank">formalistic</a> approach and
        focus on the relations of things and the methodologies they follow.
    </p>

    <h2 id="reasoning">Reasoning</h2>
    <p>
        <!-- TODO: reward function vs loss function diff -->
        The [human] brain is always active, always thinking - it's important to understand the types of thoughts that occur and (later on)
        how they correlate. Methods of reasoning are usually considered in the context of logic, and if logic seems too idealistic to apply
        to reality, remember any field of science exists for the sole purpose of being useful and cater to us, not the  other way around.<br><br>

        Smarter people before me have distinguished 3 main types of <em>logical reasoning</em> that are morphologically
        different in the direction and accuracy of asserting truth:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning" target="_blank">&lt;wiki&gt;</a></span> Deductive reasoning: </b>
            combining multiple premises to reach a strictly logical conclusion.<br>
            &#8594;Given all swans are mortal and your pet is a swan, then your pet swan is also mortal.<br>
            Deductive reasoning goes top-down, reducing statements to more informationally dense conclusions.

            </div>
            <!-- TODO: Add image with graphics  (for them all, actually) -->
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning" target="_blank">&lt;wiki&gt;</a></span> Inductive reasoning: </b>
            combining multiple observations to suggest a general principle.<br>
            &#8594;If all swans <i>seen</i> are white, then all swans must be white. (innacurate, because there're black swans)
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning" target="_blank">&lt;wiki&gt;</a></span> Abductive reasoning: </b>
            inference to the best explanation.<br>
            Abduction is opposite in direction to deduction. From an observed effect, multiple causes are considered and the most probable one is chosen.<br>
            &#8594;Swans can fly. Swans have wings. They don't use their wings when swimming. It's likely swans can fly because of their wings.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In practice we employ all types of reasoning on the daily, though it's hard to classify each thought to just a single class.
        There're two more less considered methods of reasoning that will serve us more than they do in the field of logic:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeasible_reasoning" target="_blank">&lt;wiki&gt;</a></span> Probabilistic reasoning: </b>
            dealing with uncertainty.<br>
            &#8594;If 80% of swans are white, then 20% of swans are black.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeasible_reasoning" target="_blank">&lt;wiki&gt;</a></span> Statistical reasoning: </b>
            making predictions based on past data.<br>
            &#8594;I tried to pet a swan and it bit me. Therefore, swans bite.<br>
            &#8594;I saw someone feed a swan then pet it and it didn't bite them. Therefore, swans bite 50% of the time.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You may notice how abductive reasoning can play a role in the last example. Instead of concluding swans bite 50% of the time, we can
        also take into consideration that the swan was fed before the attempted pet in one case, and wasn't in the other. Then we may come
        to the conclusion that if you try to pet a swan, it won't bite you but only if you feed it.<br><br>
        <!-- TODO: There's a famous experiment where pigeons are fed at random times but they overfit the training data and it becomes funny. -->
        Statistical reasoning is also closely related to induction. It's important to note that it's only statistical reasoning to do the
        pattern matching - observing that our current situation is most similiar to some past situation(s). Assuming the current situation will conclude
        similiarly is a type of inductive reasoning.<br><br>

        Probabilistic reasoning and statistical also seem a bit ambiguous. Statistics take advantage of data, while probabilistic reasoning
        deals with uncertainty in the data itself - for example forgetting if you fed the swan before you pet it.
